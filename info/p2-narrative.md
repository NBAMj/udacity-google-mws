## Getting started

- As usual, I copied the project documentation and rubric HTML from the Udacity classroom, pasted it into [Turndown](https://domchristie.github.io/turndown/), and saved it in Markdown files.
- We don't need to add the project 2 repo to our project. The project 2 repo is just a server that we use to fetch data.
