## Getting started

- Same strategy for the data server as in project 2, but it comes from a new repo.
- Cloned the [project 3 server repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) into a separate directory.
- I watched the [Doug Brown p3 walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7i0U1aCBok).

## Favorites

### Favorite button

- I plan to create a favorite button with *index.js* in the `createRestaurantHTML()` function.

## Reviews

### Add reviews

#### User interface

I plan to use a [Bootstrap-style modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/).

## Performance

My app was already meeting the performance benchmarks during project 2.
