### Notes to reviewer 1

Thanks for your time and feedback! I noticed that new restaurant reviews don't show up in the array at http://localhost:1337/reviews, but you can see them by entering the review ID, like http://localhost:1337/reviews/31.

#### Functionality

> :white_check_mark: Very good, it worked perfectly!

#### Responsive design

> :white_check_mark: Perfectly executed design!
>
> :white_check_mark: You've done great so far, the only minor issue I see is the missing role and label for the "Add" and "Close" anchor tags.
>
> As you've demonstrated that you are capable of including aria roles and labels I will pass this rubric point as it is a minor mistake and no show stopper, especially as your accessibility rating is beyond perfect!

#### Performance

> :white_check_mark: Exceptionally well!
